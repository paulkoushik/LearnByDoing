This is an application called LearnByDoing. The purpose of this app is to provide similar to those existing websites which provide online teaching, especially the websites where one can learn different programming language followed by acquiring a certificate.

The name of the app LearnByDoing suggests on how this platform works. The concept is that there will be different courses provided on different topics, especially for learning coding and different demonstrators will be teaching them. The demonstrators will create meaningful videos and the customers will watch them to start with.

Followed by the videos there will be practical sessions where the customers can practice on the concepts they have learnt by watching the videos. These practicals will be graded in a credit system and on completion of a standard number of credits, the customers will be given certificates for the courses they have completed as a proof that they have achieved certain expertise on that particular area.

At this point the app runs on a localhost server run by Ruby on Rails. On opening the localhost webpage, one can see few options on a catalog that has been set up (and is under construction) on the left of the page. One can also see the header of the webpage on the top with the logo for the application.

In the catalog on the left of the webpage there will be options available and one can have access to them by clicking on them. These options are basically links to the couses offered, information of the respective demonstrators, the pricings for availing the courses, news update of the page and contact information etc.

As of now few of the options work and the rest are being constructed.
